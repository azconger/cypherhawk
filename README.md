## Integration with Java Applications

### StackHawk Scanner (HawkScan)
```bash
# Extract corporate DPI certificates
./cypherhawk --output corporate-certs.pem

# Use with HawkScan
hawk scan --ca-bundle corporate-certs.pem

# For specific target testing
./cypherhawk --url https://internal.corp.com --output corp-internal.pem
hawk scan --ca-bundle corp-internal.pem

# Using environment variables
export CYPHERHAWK_OUTPUT=corporate-certs.pem
export CYPHERHAWK_URL=https://internal.corp.com
./cypherhawk
hawk scan --ca-bundle corporate-certs.pem
```

### Java Applications (PEM format - Java 9+)
```bash
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PEM \
     -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=corporate-certs.pem \
     MyApplication
```

### Java Applications (JKS format - all Java versions)
```bash
# Convert PEM to JKS
keytool -importcert -noprompt \
        -file corporate-certs.pem \
        -keystore corporate.jks \
        -storepass changeit \
        -alias corporate-ca

# Use with Java application
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=corporate.jks \
     -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit \
     MyApplication
```

### Maven
```bash
# PEM format
mvn clean install \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PEM \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=corporate-certs.pem

# JKS format
mvn clean install \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=corporate.jks \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit
```

### Gradle
```bash
./gradlew build \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=PEM \
    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=corporate-certs.pem
```

## How It Works

CypherHawk works by:

1. **Fresh CA bundle at build time** - Downloads latest Mozilla CA certificates during build to prevent stale embedded fallback bundles
2. **Runtime CA bundle download** - Downloads Mozilla's trusted CA bundle from multiple sources with cross-validation and integrity checking
3. **Enhanced TLS connections** - Uses HashiCorp go-retryablehttp with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and corporate proxy support
4. **Analyzing certificate chains** using browser-like validation logic with structured logging and enhanced behavioral analysis
5. **Detecting unknown CAs** that aren't in Mozilla's trusted bundle using advanced threat detection
6. **Performing security analysis** with Certificate Transparency validation, 10+ behavioral indicators, and CA impersonation detection
7. **Vendor identification** using 15+ enterprise DPI vendor patterns with confidence scoring
8. **Extracting CA certificates** in HawkScan-optimized PEM format with comprehensive usage instructions

### Default Test Endpoints

- `https://www.google.com` - Primary connectivity test
- `https://auth.stackhawk.com` - StackHawk authentication service
- `https://api.stackhawk.com` - StackHawk API service  
- `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` - AWS S3 for pre-signed URLs

## Security Features

### Advanced Threat Detection

- **Certificate Transparency Validation**: Checks for SCT extensions in recent certificates
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects 10+ suspicious certificate indicators including:
  - Weak cryptographic keys (RSA < 2048 bits, ECDSA < 256 bits)
  - Suspicious serial numbers and recent issuance patterns
  - Weak signature algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
  - Suspicious subject/issuer terms
- **CA Impersonation Detection**: Identifies certificates falsely claiming to be from legitimate CAs
- **Risk Scoring**: Combines multiple indicators for high-confidence detection

### Enterprise DPI Vendor Detection

CypherHawk recognizes certificates from 15+ major enterprise security vendors with confidence scoring:

- **Palo Alto Networks** - Next-Generation Firewalls and Prisma Access
- **Zscaler** - Cloud Security Platform and Private Access
- **Netskope** - Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
- **Forcepoint** - Web Security and Data Protection
- **Cisco/BlueCoat** - Web Security Appliance and Cloud Web Security
- **McAfee/Trellix** - Web Gateway and Network Security Platform
- **Symantec/Broadcom** - ProxySG and Web Security Service
- **Check Point** - Threat Prevention and Mobile Access
- **Fortinet** - FortiGate and FortiProxy
- **Sophos** - XG Firewall and Cloud Optix
- **iBoss** - Cloud Security Platform
- **Menlo Security** - Isolation Platform
- **Wandera/Jamf** - Mobile Threat Defense
- **CrowdStrike** - Falcon Go and Cloud Workload Protection
- **CloudFlare for Teams** - Zero Trust Network Access

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Success (no DPI detected or analysis completed)
- `1` - Partial failure (some endpoints failed but operation completed)
- `2` - Complete failure (unable to complete operation)

## Supported Platforms

- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (amd64, arm64) 
- Windows (amd64, arm64)

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaakaww/cypherhawk.git
cd cypherhawk

# Quick build (downloads fresh CA bundle + includes code quality checks)
make build

# Clean build (removes embedded CA bundle for completely fresh download)
make clean && make build

# Update CA bundle manually
make update-ca-bundle

# Full development workflow
make pre-commit  # Run all checks + tests before committing

# Run tests
make test

# Cross-platform builds (downloads fresh CA bundle)
make build-all

# Code quality checks
make check      # Format check + vet + lint
make fmt        # Fix formatting issues
```

**Important:** Always use `make build` rather than direct `go build` commands. The embedded CA bundle is downloaded fresh at build time and is not checked into git.

## Security Considerations

CypherHawk is a **defensive security tool** designed to help users adapt to corporate security infrastructure:

- **Legitimate purpose**: Detects and extracts CA certificates from corporate DPI/MitM proxies with advanced threat analysis
- **Multiple CA bundle validation**: Cross-validates Mozilla's trusted CA bundles from multiple sources with integrity checking
- **Advanced security validation**: Combines Certificate Transparency checking, behavioral analysis, and CA impersonation detection
- **No malicious capability**: Cannot create, modify, or bypass security controls
- **Read-only operation**: Only extracts and outputs certificate information with comprehensive security analysis
- **No telemetry**: Tool does not send usage data or certificates to external services
- **Local operation**: All certificate analysis performed locally with enhanced security algorithms
