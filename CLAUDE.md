## Project Type
- **Language:** Go with high-quality external modules
- **Type:** CLI application for defensive security analysis
- **Distribution:** Single static binary with minimal dependencies
- **Dependencies:** HashiCorp go-retryablehttp, Cobra CLI framework, Viper configuration
- **Validation:** Multiple Mozilla CA bundle sources with cross-validation
- **Architecture:** Modular internal packages with robust external libraries
- **Security Focus:** Corporate DPI detection, threat analysis, defensive tooling
- **Logging:** Structured logging with configurable levels for enterprise debugging

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development (enhanced CLI with Cobra framework)
go run ./cmd/cypherhawk              # Run the tool with default settings
go run ./cmd/cypherhawk --url https://example.com  # Run with custom target URL
go run ./cmd/cypherhawk --output certs.pem # Save certificates to file
go run ./cmd/cypherhawk detect --verbose --analyze  # Enhanced analysis with structured logging
go run ./cmd/cypherhawk version      # Show version information
go test -v ./...               # Run comprehensive tests with mock DPI simulation

# Build (includes fresh CA bundle download)
make build                    # Build with latest Mozilla CA bundle
make update-ca-bundle         # Manually update CA bundle
go build -o cypherhawk ./cmd/cypherhawk  # Build single binary (uses existing CA bundle)

# Cross-platform builds (advanced)
make build-all      # Build for all platforms with fresh CA bundle
make package        # Create release archives
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
```

## Development Workflow

1. Use `go run ./cmd/cypherhawk -url <target>` for testing during development
2. Use `make build` to create local binary with fresh CA bundle for testing
3. Use `go test -v ./...` to run comprehensive functional tests with simulated DPI environments
4. Use `make build-all` for cross-platform binaries when preparing releases (includes CA bundle update)
5. Use `make update-ca-bundle` to manually refresh the embedded CA bundle
6. Test against various corporate environments when possible

**Important:** Always use `make build` or `make build-all` for production builds to ensure the embedded CA bundle is fresh. Direct `go build` commands will fail if no embedded bundle exists.

**Build System Design:**
- `make clean` removes the embedded CA bundle to force fresh downloads
- `make build` downloads latest CA bundle before building 
- No static CA bundle is checked into git - always downloaded fresh
- CI/CD builds always get the latest Mozilla CA certificates

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Core Principles
- **Zero external dependencies** - Uses only Go standard library for easy distribution
- **Single binary** - Customers can download and run immediately
- **Cross-platform** - Supports Linux, macOS, Windows (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Enterprise-focused** - Designed for corporate environments with DPI
- **Mozilla CA validation** - Uses Mozilla's trusted CA bundle for accurate MitM detection

### Key Components
- **Build-time CA bundle updates** - Downloads latest Mozilla CA certificates during build process to prevent stale embedded bundles
- **Multiple CA bundle sources** - Cross-validates Mozilla CA bundles from multiple sources with integrity checking
- **Enhanced HTTP client** - HashiCorp go-retryablehttp for robust networking with enterprise proxy support
- **Professional CLI** - Cobra framework with subcommands, configuration files, and structured help
- **Structured logging** - Go 1.21+ slog with configurable levels for enterprise debugging
- **Enhanced certificate chain validation** - Browser-like certificate verification with hostname validation
- **Certificate Transparency validation** - Checks for SCT extensions in recent certificates
- **Comprehensive behavioral analysis** - 10+ suspicious behavior indicators including weak keys, recent issuance, unusual validity periods
- **CA impersonation detection** - Detects certificates claiming to be from legitimate CAs but with suspicious characteristics
- **DPI vendor identification** - Recognizes major enterprise security vendors (Palo Alto, Netskope, Zscaler)
- **Risk scoring system** - Combines multiple security indicators for high-confidence detection
- **Flexible target URLs** - Supports custom target URLs via `--url` flag (default: 4 endpoints)
- **PEM extraction** - Outputs unknown CA certificates in standard PEM format
- **Complete DPI testing infrastructure** - Standalone server, mitmproxy, and Squid setups with cross-platform validation scripts

## Security Considerations

This is a **defensive security tool** designed to help users adapt to corporate security infrastructure:

**Tool Security:**
- **Legitimate purpose** - Detects and extracts CA certificates from corporate DPI/MitM proxies with advanced threat analysis
- **Multiple CA bundle validation** - Cross-validates Mozilla's trusted CA bundles from multiple sources (curl.se and GitHub mirror) with integrity checking
- **Advanced security validation** - Combines Certificate Transparency checking, behavioral analysis, and CA impersonation detection
- **No malicious capability** - Cannot create, modify, or bypass security controls
- **Read-only operation** - Only extracts and outputs certificate information with comprehensive security analysis

**Network Security:**
- **HTTPS download** - Mozilla CA bundles downloaded over secure HTTPS connections from multiple trusted sources
- **InsecureSkipVerify usage** - Only used for certificate inspection, not for validation bypass
- **Certificate Transparency validation** - Checks for proper CT evidence in recent certificates to detect potential forgeries
- **Behavioral analysis protection** - Detects multiple categories of suspicious certificate characteristics
- **CA impersonation protection** - Identifies certificates falsely claiming to be from legitimate certificate authorities
- **No credential handling** - Tool does not store, transmit, or log any sensitive information
- **Local operation** - All certificate analysis performed locally with enhanced security algorithms

**Data Privacy:**
- **No telemetry** - Tool does not send usage data or certificates to external services
- **Local file output** - Certificate data only written to user-specified local files
- **Ephemeral operation** - No persistent storage of sensitive data beyond user-requested output

**Corporate Environment Safety:**
- **Transparent operation** - Tool clearly reports which endpoints it tests and why
- **Graceful failure** - Continues operation even if some endpoints are blocked
- **Audit-friendly** - All actions logged and can be monitored by corporate security tools

## Error Handling Strategy

**Network Errors:**
- **Connection timeouts** - 10-second timeout per endpoint with clear error messages
- **Retry logic** - Exponential backoff with 3 attempts max for retryable errors
- **DNS resolution failures** - Graceful handling with specific corporate network guidance
- **Certificate parsing errors** - Continue processing other certificates, report parsing failures
- **HTTP errors** - Distinguish between network issues and HTTP status errors
- **Proxy support** - Enhanced proxy authentication and configuration error handling

**Certificate Processing:**
- **Invalid certificate chains** - Log errors but continue processing valid certificates
- **Mozilla CA bundle failures** - Fall back to embedded backup bundle or clear error message
- **PEM encoding errors** - Skip malformed certificates, report count of skipped items
- **Duplicate detection** - Handle duplicate certificates across endpoints gracefully

**File Operations:**
- **Output file permissions** - Create files with appropriate permissions (0644)
- **Disk space** - Check available space before writing large certificate bundles
- **File locking** - Handle concurrent access to output files

**User Experience:**
- **Progress indicators** - Show progress when testing multiple endpoints
- **Verbose mode** - Detailed error reporting with `--verbose` flag
